# Batch-Renderer
A batch renderer written in Python, Cython and OpenGL.

__Goal:__ To write a blazingly fast graphics engine in modern OpenGL(4.1) with the power of Cython.\
__Long Term Plans:__ Use cross platform graphics api such as bgfx for better compatibility (OpenGL is deprecated by Apple, don't know how long it will last before they remove OpenGL drivers).
