# Batch-Renderer
A batch renderer written in Python, Cython and OpenGL.

__Goal:__ To write a blazingly fast graphics engine in modern OpenGL(4.1) with the power of Cython.\
__Furture Plans:__ Use cross platform graphics api such as bgfx for better compatibility. OpenGL is deprecated by Apple, and I don't know how long it will last before they remove OpenGL drivers. In addition, OpenGL drivers on macs are kind of bad (only 16 texture slots).
